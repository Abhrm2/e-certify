# Decentralized Secure Cloud Storage Using Blockchain


We developed this system as a final year Thesis project during our Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering. The project was supervised by Prof. Dr. Subarna Shakya and Er. Sandip Pandey. 

In short, the project is a peer-to-peer network that allows user to upload his files to several nodes of the system  and retrieve it back. Several cryptographic measures were used to ensure file protection and user anonymity. ERC20 tokens was used as a means to pay for the service of the nodes. Learn more about the project at my [official website](https://erbipin.com/projects/1_project/)

For the details of each and everything used, please go through the final thesis report.
